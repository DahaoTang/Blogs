## User's Guide

This project renders markdown files into web pages to boost the process of writing and posting blogs.

To create a new post, simply add a new folder under `./public/blogs/<Name_of_the_Blog>`. Inside the folder, create a markdown file `main.md` to write the blog. If the blog contains images or other resources, simply create a folder called `assets` at the same level as the `main.md` file for storing the resources.
