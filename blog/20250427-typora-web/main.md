# New Website Release: Typora-based

[Home](../../main.html)

April 27, 2025

My blog website has been shifted to be built upon static HTML files which are generated from Markdown files with [Typora](https://typora.io/) under the theme Newsprint.

However, the code containing the customized Markdown Parser can still be found on the branch `customized-parser-version` [here](https://github.com/DahaoTang/Blogs/tree/customized-parser-version).
